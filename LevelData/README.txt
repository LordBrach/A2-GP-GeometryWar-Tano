So you want to make a level for Hiraishin ?
It isnt complicated at all
Here's a "pattern"

ooxoo

The 'o' represents empty spaces, meanwhile the 'x' represents a wall, an obstacle for the enemy
The file is read top to bottom, the leftmost character being at the lowest on the screen and the rightmost at the top

For now, the file only expects 5 characters per line and only reads 'x', if you put anything else it won't change anything

here's an example of how a "level" will look like:

ooooo
ooooo
ooooo
oxoxo
ooooo
xoxox
ooooo
oxoxo
ooooo
xoxxx
ooxxx
oxxxx
ooxxx
xoxxx
ooooo
ooooo

have fun !
